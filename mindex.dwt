		     <h1>Welcome to PC Pest Control</h1>
		     <p>We take pride in providing quality pest control services to all our customers.   Our work is effective, timely, and safe.  After one of our technicians provide pest control services most pests should be gone within a week with the exception of spiders that may take two weeks.   We do our best to get it right the first time to prevent you the hassle of having to deal with unwanted pests.  If you need an additional treatment, we invite you to conveniently request one here.</p>
		     <p>Our services focuses on eliminating pests while keeping your home, family, and pets safe.   The controlled use of many products absolutely plays a part in effective pest control. However, we use our knowledge of animal biology and behavior to actively look for safe solutions that minimize product applications.</p>

             <h2>Commercial Pest Control</h2>
             <p>We value consistency and believe it benefits our customers.   That’s why after your initial treatment, you will have the same tech each time we service your home for unwanted pests unless there is an emergency or a route boundary change.  We want to earn your loyalty for a friendly, long-term relationship. If your technician suggests a termite treatment or other ‘extra’ program, he genuinely believes this is in your best interest.</p>
